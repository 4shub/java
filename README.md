# Java Quickstart Guide
## Introduction
This guide was built for myself and others as a quick jumpstart into the world of Java programming. This is not an indepth tutorial on how to program in Java, but rather a reference guide for those who may want to try out Java and know other languages.

Feel free to fork and add additional info.

## Environment
There are many IDEs for Java development. The two most popular IDEs are [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) and [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/). **If you are developing for android, please check out [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) too.**

## Initialization
To start a simple project, navigate to your IDE's project creation wizard. For the sake of simplicty, give it the name `helloworld` and name your first project file `helloworld.java`

Once created, your programming environment should either give you the following or a blank space. (If you do get a blank environment, paste the following code down)
```
public class helloworld {
  
}
```

### Deconstructing 
  - `Public` allows this class to be used anywhere else in your program
  - `Class` is essentially an object used in Java. It's used in this case to identify `helloworld` as a `class`.
  - `helloworld` the name of your class. It should also be the name of your file.
